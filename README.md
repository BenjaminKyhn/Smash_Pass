# Smash Pass
Smash Pass is a catalogue of multiplayer games that you can use as inspiration to a LAN party or just some couch gaming with your friends.
The users can rate games and the average user rating is presented in the app as a SMASH FACTOR.

## Note:
We're using Google Sign-In and Firebase authentication, but since the app is still in the developing phase, you will not be able to login, unless you supply us with your unique SHA1 fingerprint. When the app is released, a special release SHA1 fingerprint will be added to Firebase authentication, which will let all users login with their Google accounts.
